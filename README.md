<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This Restoutant is for Wagyu beef lovers and those who appreciate exquisite cuisine, and wine.Based on expiriances in this work area, this website will be perfect for every visitor.It's very simple to navigate and get overview over its Wagyu beef specialist,also u can get information about winelist,location,menu,opening hours and is also possible for guests to book a table.</p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>

* This website is created for "Restourant La Tana" so the guests can get fast information where to find it and eventualy to book a table.

* The main aims of this website is to inform new costumers about menu ,location, opening hours, to present diches , and to teach a costumers about Wagyu beef.
 
 * A user can learn about Restourant most exquisite offers.

 <h1>Scope</h1>
  
  * <strong>Header</strong> containing navigation bar and restourant logo.
  * <strong>Navbar</strong> is provided with 2 dropdown menus,gallery and contact.
  * <strong>Coursel slide</strong> contains two slides one is Restourant image and other is Wagyu image whicis provided with <strong>Learn more</strong> button.

<h1>Structure</h1>

* I decided to create a single-page website,In the navigation bar you can find fast way to see a  menu (food menu and winelist) then About (Wagyu stake,What is so specal about wagyu cattle,intesting facts about most paired wine with Wagyu stake) ,Gallery ( if guest is intrested to see which  dishes are made in Restourant) and Contact (contact is only by call ,like in real life this makes things much easer for guests and stuff).Navigation bar include links that will take guest to desired  section. I decided to fill whole website with presentation and photos to promote restourant so guests can get informed about specialties of this place.

<h1>Skeleton</h1>

*  I had originally thought about creating a website with a homepage and separate pages ,later i decided to put all in one page to create a better flow.WIREFRAMES (wireframes are diffrent from the original wireframe but they share same idea)
