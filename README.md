<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This Restaurant is for Wagyu beef lovers and those who appreciate exquisite cuisine, and wine. Based on experiences in this work area, this website will be perfect for every visitor. It's very simple to navigate and get overview over its Wagyu beef specialist, also u can get information about wine list, location,menu, opening hours.</p>

<h1>Strategy</h1>

* This website is created for "Restourant La Tana" so the guests can get fast information where to find it and eventually to book a table.

* The main aims of this website is to inform new costumers about menu,location, opening hours, to present dishes, and to teach costumers about Wagyu beef.
 
 * A user can learn about Restourant most exquisite offers.


<h1>Structure</h1>

* I decided to create a single-page website, In the navigation bar you can find fast way to see a menu (food menu and wine list) then About (Wagyu stake, What is so special about wagyu cattle,interesting facts about most paired wine with Wagyu stake),Gallery (if guest is interested to see which  dishes are made in Restaurant) and Contact (contact is only by call,like in real life this makes things much easier for guests and stuff). Navigation bar include links that will take guest to desired section. I decided to fill whole website with presentation and photos to promote restaurant so guests can get informed about specialties of this place.

<h1>Skeleton</h1>

*  I had originally thought about creating a website with a homepage and separate pages,later I decided to put all in one page to create a better flow. (wireframes are different from the original wireframe, but they share same idea.)

 <h1>Surface</h1>
 
 * I wanted the design to be clean and elegant.I didn't want to mix too many colors because of this reason, I thought black and white are the most elegant and clean.  Website contains many photos for marketing reasons.
