<h1>Strategy</h1>

* This website is created for "Restourant La Tana" so the guests can get fast information where to find it and eventualy to book a table.

* The main aims of this website is to inform new costumers about menu ,location, opening hours, to present diches , and to teach a costumers about Wagyu beef.
 
 * A user can learn about Restourant most exquisite offers.


<h1>Structure</h1>

* I decided to create a single-page website,In the navigation bar you can find fast way to see a  menu (food menu and winelist) then About (Wagyu stake,What is so specal about wagyu cattle,intesting facts about most paired wine with Wagyu stake) ,Gallery ( if guest is intrested to see which  dishes are made in Restourant) and Contact (contact is only by call ,like in real life this makes things much easer for guests and stuff).Navigation bar include links that will take guest to desired  section. I decided to fill whole website with presentation and photos to promote restourant so guests can get informed about specialties of this place.

<h1>Skeleton</h1>

*  I had originally thought about creating a website with a homepage and separate pages ,later i decided to put all in one page to create a better flow. [WIREFRAMES](/assets) (wireframes are diffrent from the original wireframe but they share same idea.)
 
 <h1>Surface</h1>
 
 * I wanted the design to be clean and elegant.I didn't want to mix too many colours because of this reason , i thought black nad white are the most elegant and clean.  Website contain many photos for marketing reasons.
